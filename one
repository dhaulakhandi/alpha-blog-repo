"<div>The clinic I work at now is understaffed so I float between Medical Assisting&nbsp;and Lab tech. A few weeks ago I came in 30 minutes before my shift and I was preparing a room. One of the physician&#39;s&nbsp;patients arrived early and there were also 2 other patients ready for other doctors. I was getting them ready and taking vitals. She was kind of in a rush to get the day started and I told her I just have a few things to do and then I can help her right after that.&nbsp;</div>
"
"<div>Being understaffed, teamwork is very important, so I make sure to go above and beyond and constantly sharing responsibilities so no one feels over wheled. We like to alternate so the workload is even.</div>

"<div>When I worked for a hand surgeon, I was the only help that she had. I performed as her MA and Admin Assistant. Within the first 2 weeks, and I still wasn&#39;t properly trained since she had been so busy. We kind of had conflict with that and I suggested&nbsp;we had a sit down and go ver some proper training, and check list&nbsp;and we just talked and never had any issues after that.&nbsp;</div>
